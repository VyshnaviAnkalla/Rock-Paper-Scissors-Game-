# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-

Developed an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating both frontend UI design and backend logic for real-time gameplay.

Frontend: Designed a responsive UI with flexbox, hover effects, and dynamic styling for a smooth user experience. Implemented real-time score updates and interactive game messages.
Backend: Built the game logic using JavaScript, including a randomized AI move generator, event-driven user interactions, and dynamic DOM manipulation for seamless updates.
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend & Backend Logic)

This project showcases my expertise in interactive web development, event-driven programming, and real-time UI updates.
